# Qworum class ontology

An RDF ontology for describing Qworum classes and the interfaces they implement:

- Interfaces can extend zero, one, or many other interfaces.
- A Qworum class implements exactly one interface.
- For their properties, method parameters and method-local classes, Qworum classes can indicate which actual interface implementations they are using.
